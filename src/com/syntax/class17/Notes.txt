Types of variables:
There are 3 types of variables: local, instance and static

Local variable: inside the method
Instance variable: outside the method but inside the class
Static variable: its instance variable that has static

Class Vars{
    int age = 10;   // instance variable

    static double weight = 25.5;   // static variable

    void method(){
        String name = "Moreed";  // local variable
    }
}

local variables:
if a variable is defined inside a method or loop or switch or any other block of code it is called local variable.

Instance variables:
if a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class then it is called an instance variable.

Static variables:
If a variable is not declared inside a method but it is inside a class and it has static keyword with it when
it is called a static variable.

When to use which type of variable:
Local variables:
Local variables should always be preferred over instance and static variables
why? because they occupy the computer's memory for very, very short amount of times.
as soon as their purpose is served Java destroys them.
Pros: save memory
Cons: not accessible outside of methods/block of code

Instance Variables:
when we want to share something in multiple methods of a class and the information is expected to be different from
object to object we should go with instance variables.
Pros: accessible in all the methods of a class
Cons: occupy the computer's memory for longer than local variables.

Static variables:
when we know that information will stay same for all the objects of a class we should create a static variable
for that.
Pros: single memory location for all objects of a class
Cons: stay longer in the memory
      can hold only one value at a time.
