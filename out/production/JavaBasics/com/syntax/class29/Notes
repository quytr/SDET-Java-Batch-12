Set in Java:
    Set is an interface in collections framework which is implemented by many classes.
    For example: Hashset, LinkedHashSet, and TreeSet.
Properties of Set:
    All the Sets don't allow duplicates.
HashSet:
    1. HashSet does not maintain the insertion order.
    2. It is the fastest in all Sets.
    3. Most widely used Set.
LinkedHashSet:
    1. Maintains the insertion order.
    2. Slower than HashSet but faster than TreeSet specially the insertions.
TreeSet:
    1. Sorts the data in natural order. For number in increasing order
    2. It is the slowest when it comes to store data.
When to use which type of Set:
    1. If we don't care about insertion order and data being sorted always use HashSet.
    2. If we need the insertion order, we don't have much choice, we have to use the LinkedHashSet. But if we don't
    care about insertion order, we can compare it with TreeSet.
    LinkedHashSet                     vs                    TreeSet:
        - Insertion is not slow                                - Slowest insertion
        - Retrieval is super slow                              - Slower than HashSet but faster than LinkedHashSet
I don't care about insertion order but I care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
- HashSet
I care about insertion order but I don't care about retrieval speed which Set should I use?
- LinkedHashSet
If I want to have sorted data all the time?
- TreeSet
