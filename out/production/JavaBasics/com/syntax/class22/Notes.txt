Super keyword:
super is keyword like "this" keyword, but it refers to the parent class object. We can use the super keyword in 3 different
ways.
1. To access the super class variables if we have the same named variables in super class and base class.
2. If we have the same method names in parent and child class, we can use the super keyword to access the parent class
method. Otherwise, by default Java refers to the child class methods.
3. As constructors don't participate in inheritance, we can use super() to call the constructors from the parent class.

Rules:
1. If we have a constructor in the parent class that takes 2 argument, we must have a constructor inside the child class
that at least takes those 2 arguments.
2. We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor.
3. super can't be used in static methods. Static belongs to the class not the object.

Method overloading in Java:
If we have same named methods in a class with different number of parameters or different sequence of parameters or
different data types of the parameters, it is called method overloading.
class calculator{

    add(int num1, int num2){

    }
    add(double num1, double num2){

    }
    add(double num1, int num2){

    }
    add(int num1, double num2){

    }
    add(int num1, int num2, int num3){

    }
}
