Maps and Sets are data structure

Maps in Java:
    It's a data structure that allows us to store key value pairs.
    1. Searching is efficient.
    2. We can use any types of keys like Double String char etc. We are not restricted to integer based natural indexes.
There are many types of maps but we will be discussing only 4 of them.
1. HashMap      2. LinkedHashMap        3. TreeMap      4. HashTable(old)

Retrieval means getting back the data from data structure
HashMap:
    1. HashMap is the fastest one when it comes to inserting and retrieving the data.
    2. Insertion order is NOT maintained.
    3. Most widely used map.

LinkedHashMap:
    1. LinkedHashMap maintains the insertion order.
    2. Insertion speed is same as HashMap.
    3. Retrieval is the slowest one.

TreeMap:
    1. Data is sorted based on the natural order.
    2. Insertion is slowest because of the sorting.

HashTable:
    Is a thread safe data means it can handle multiple insertions and retrievals at the same time from multiple
    CPU cores byt because of thread safety feature it is also very slow so if you are sure that you will never
    write multithreading code never use it.
