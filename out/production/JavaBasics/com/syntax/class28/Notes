Wrapper classes:
    They are object types for all the primitive types. When we use the wrapper classes, we get all the benefits of classes
and objects for example we can have methods.
Also, generics works with only classes.
Generic is a concept of Java that helps us...

*Interview* Difference between array vs ArrayList

Boxing in wrapper classes: (candy in a wrapper)
    boxing happens when we convert a primitive to corresponding wrapper type.
    int num = 10;
    Integer num2 = new Integer(num)  //boxing

    unboxing happens when we convert a wrapper object to a corresponding primitive type
    Integer num2 = new Integer(10);
    int num = num2.intValue();

    Integer num = 10;  //autoBoxing
    int num2 = num;   //autoBoxing

List (it is an interface in frame which is implemented by two classes

ArrayList vs LinkedList
Similar:
1. We can store the duplicate values in lists,
2. Insertion order is maintained.
(the order in which you are adding elements to the data structure)
When to use ArrayList:
1. If most of the operations are reading and storing new data and not shifting or changing the position of data then we
should go with array list.
ex: houses, building, house number,...

When to use LinkedList:
When most of the operations are related to changing the position of data or related to data shifting, then we should go
with LinkedList
ex: tennis ranking, scoreboard,...

What is dynamic?


If we are using any operation that can change the size of array, DO NOT use the for loop

When you are doing any operations on the lists that can change its size, using Iterator otherwise you can use loops.

Set:
    Sets do not allow duplicate value and no insertion order
