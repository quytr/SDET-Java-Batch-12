RECAP:
Types of variables:
There are three types of variables local, instance and static.

local variables:
The variables that are declared inside a method or block of code are called local variables.
Pros: Save Memory.
Cons: limited access can not be accessed outside of methods or block of code where they are declared.

Instance variables:
The variables which are declared inside a class but, outside a method or block of code are called instance variables.
Pros: instance variables are accessible in all the methods of that class
Cons: they occupy the computers' memory for longer as compared to local variables

Static variables:
if instance variables have the static keyword with them, they are called static variables.
Pros: Single memory location for all the objects of that class.
Cons: Can hold only one value for all the objects and stays even longer inside the memory than instance variables.

Access modifiers:
Access modifiers are keywords in java that defines from where a certain variable, method  or a class
etc. can be accessed.
There are 4 types of access in java that we can define using 3 keywords
1. private
2. protected
3. public
4. default (not a keyword, applied when no keyword is used)

private access (keyword is private):
When we use the private keyword with any of the variables, methods or classes, these can only be accessed within
that class.

default access (applied when we don't use any keyword):
When we don't use any of the keywords default access is applied by Java to those variables methods or classes etc.
which means these things can only be accessed from the same package.

protected access (we use the protected class):
When protected access is applied class members(variables methods etc.) can be accessed from other packages but only
in the classes that participate in inheritance.

public access (public keyword):
public means class members and classes can be accessed from anywhere inside that project.
