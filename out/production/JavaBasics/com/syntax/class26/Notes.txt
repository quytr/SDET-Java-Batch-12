Abstraction in Java:
    Hiding the implementation details and providing the functionality only.
    Two Methods to achieve abstractions:
        1. Abstract classes
        2. Interfaces
Abstract classes:
    Abstract classes are classes with abstract keyword.

Interface:
    Interfaces are the contracts that we create with the help of interface keyword.

How to decide which one to use:
    1. Prefer the interfaces over abstract classes.
    2. If 2 or more classes are closely related to each other, go with abstract classes. For example, if we have to create
    a Lion and a Horse class. We should go with abstract classes and should create an animal abstract class.
    If 2 classes are not related to each other, for example, and Apple and a Cloth, we should create an interface for
    that like if we want to have a behavior washAble.

Encapsulation:
    It is the fourth pillar of OPPS. It provides security and better control over the data of a class.
    We create classes and inside those classes we create private fields and methods. These methods are call getter setter
    methods, and we set and get the values of the class fields with the help of these methods instead of accessing and
    modifying them directly.
