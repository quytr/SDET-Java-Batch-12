inheritance (using extends) in Java: *interview*
    It's a mechanism in Java through which a child class gets the properties and methods from its parent class.
    (then explain how thing works)
Benefits:
    1. Save time to code
    2. code duplication is reduced
    3. execution time is faster
Disadvantages:
    Classes are tightly coupled if we change something in parent class, it is also changed in the child class.

Types of inheritance:
    There are 4 types of inheritance but Java only supports 3 of them
    1. single
    2. hierarchical
    3. multilevel
    4. multiple (not supported in Java)

Single inheritance:
    In single inheritance, we have only one child and one parent class or only 2 classes participate in inheritance one
    as child, one as parent.
class Parent{

}
class Child extends Parent{

}

Hierarchical:
    In hierarchical inheritance we have a single Parent class and multiple child classes
class Parent{

}
class Child1 extends Parent{

}
class Child2 extends Parent{

}

Multilevel:
    We have multiple levels of inheritance.
    for example if we have classes A B C. class C will be inherited from B and B will be inherited from A
class A{

}
class B extends A{

}
class C extends B{

}
=============================================================================================================
super keyword:
super keyword is like the "this" keyword. It refers to the parent class object.
for example: we can access the fields method or constructors or parent class inside the child class suing this keyword.
            first Java will search for local variable, then it will search for instance variable, then parent class.
Constructors from the parent class don't participate in inheritance, we need to create a matching constructor in the
child classes as well.
We can use super() to call the constructor from the parent class so that we don't have to repeat the code.
We can't use this() and super() inside the same constructor *interview*
class AAA{
    AAA(){
    }
}
class BBB extends AAA{
    String name;
    BBB(){
    }
    BBB(String name){
        super();
//        this();
        this.name = name;
    }
}
